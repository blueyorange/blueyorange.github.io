A web scraping project to convert bbc bitesize quizzes into google forms.

BBC Bitesize produces web quizzes to test individuals on their comprehension. I wanted to use them to assess understanding of a lesson.

I used JSDOM in a node project to handle the parsing of the BBC Bitesize web page. The google forms API was used to create a new quiz.
