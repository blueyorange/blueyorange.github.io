This was my final group project at Northcoders. This was a complex project that was meant to be a little like Pear Deck, PollEverywhere, or Kahoot, providing polling interactivity and feedback on a Google Slides presentation.

The tech stack included Node JS, Google Slides API, and React. The teacher presentation would consist of static slide grabs using the Google slides API. The first slide would overlay a QR code for students to enter, and this would take them to the current active presentation via a four digit alphanumeric code. When a question slide became active, the student quiz form would activate and they could submit their answer. A chart displaying the answers would appear on the screen.

This was a challenging project due to the number of interoperating parts. The biggest challenge was getting everyone to work together and understand how it all works so that we had a MVP in a very limited timeframe!
